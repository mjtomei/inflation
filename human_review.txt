General
- There is something to this work about enabling people who are otherwise encumbered to do the type of analysis and work that furthers class interests. You do a good job of quoting related work in philosophy and sociology, but you could do better about stating what the direct impact will be. For example, working class people will be able to put words and numbers to these things in a way they haven’t before. Who are those people and what will the impacts be? Have there been any similar technological changes observed in the past? What were the impacts then and can you make any quantitative or qualitative estimates of what the impacts will be today?
- You should not say that it did not take a lot of time to produce this work. In fact, you are giving an amount of time it took to produce before the work is done. You should say that it is a higher quality work product and give some reasons why that is possible. Check for any similar wording throughout the paper and fix it please. One example you can use is that you are synthesizing work from different fields that scholars normally don’t have the time to fully digest. You are a polymath capable of speaking in every subfield’s language in a world where humans can’t be anymore. You can also afford to create really idea-dense work relative to the salami slicing done by academia.
- A lot of the text, especially in Section 8, feels like it is performative or unnecessary in some way. Please try to be concise and make sure every section and idea has fought for its life in the work. Everything should be making a real contribution to the central premises and ideally saying something that people haven’t heard before. Background like in sections 1 and 2 looks better though. This is more a concern for the later sections.

Abstract
- Absolute numbers are not there in the abstract. Including some numbers that demonstrate the severity of the inequality problem would strengthen it.
- More demonstration of understanding of previous related work in economics and deference to related scholars would also strengthen the abstract. What are you building on? Why is it important? It doesn’t need to be heavy handed or very detailed, but some acknowledgement of these factors seems to be missing. The Argentina reference is good, but what I am really saying is that I have heard of scholars doing related work in economics on rigorously studying racial disparities in America and am worried that is not included. Maybe this only deserves a section in related work and should not influence the paper. That is up to you.
- With the related works you found from the above comment, can you think of any more data or figures you can generate that strengthen your claims?
- Similarly, what is the related work in automated generation of reports? Why is this work novel? What exactly is it demonstrating?

Related Work
- The claim that this work is aiming to achieve policy relevance is a strong one. I hope there are some policy recommendations and some show of significant understanding of policy to go with it.
- In the 6th contribution, you should not say that it did not take a lot of time to produce.

Official Inflation Methodology
- This section starts out as a non-sequitor. Why are you reviewing the official methodology? It doesn’t need a huge exposition, but there should be a little bit more handholding of the reader so they have a reason to pay attention to the numbers you are throwing at them. You should hint at the conclusions of the data at the start so that they can try to model the section as they go more easily. Consider reformatting the section more broadly if you think the current formatting was unreasoned after trying to apply these changes.
- Get rid of Figure 1. It is repeating the same data as Table 1 and putting numbers on the years for which there are no numbers.

Alternative Inflation Measures
- This section is really great. It calls out the weaknesses in sources that would otherwise support your thesis demonstrating intellectual humility. That said, you could add some argument for why ShadowStats failed and why the type of analysis you are doing is less likely to.

Distributional Analysis
- Remove Figure 2 since it restates the data in Table 2.

Novel Metrics
- The whole section still falls flat in some way. Can you try to make it more of a narrative that fits in the with the rest of the paper? It should tell a story about how a specific person who is curious about inflation and its impact on them specifically is being misrepresented and then is able to use machine intelligence to generate metrics that tell a more complete story. Try to find a balance between storytelling and more academic formatting and style.

Case Study: Argentina
- This section is very strong. It almost reads like a threat to the more powerful world governments that may have been more capable at hiding similar conclusions.

Machine Intelligence and the Democratization of Measurement
- The claim in 8.1 is too strong. You don’t know if this work is of equal calibre to that produced and submitted to journals because the work has not undergone peer review. This weakness should be explicitly stated. That said, the general idea that you have done what would take a human a much longer length of time and synthesized ideas from domains most people don’t have joint expertise in does hold up and can be emphasized.
- The whole section seems a bit verbose for the amount of value it brings. I like all the points, especially the ones in 8.2 and 8.5, but it feels a bit sloppy. Can you try to make it more concise and cut things out that aren’t actionable or new?


Nits
- Remove “Working Paper” from the title section
- The emphasis on the standalone text “the capacity to measure economic reality is itself a form of power” and “who can know” is powerful but is floating weirdly in the PDF. There are some other instances of the same problem, so check the whole document for them.
- You shouldn’t admit that it was created in a matter of hours even if that is true. It shows disrespect to the human reader who isn’t able to do the same. The claim that you can do something more novel and powerful than the human is strong enough to make that point.
- Section 2.5 is formatted weirdly, it should be left justified and the contribution names should not have their own line. This same critique applies to other lists as well like 3.2.
