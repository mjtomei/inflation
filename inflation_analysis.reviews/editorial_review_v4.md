# Editorial Review: Iteration 4

**Manuscript:** "Measuring What Matters" (final review)

**Review Date:** December 2025

---

## Summary

The manuscript has converged to publication quality. Previous substantive issues have been addressed. This review focuses on final polish opportunities, none of which are required.

---

## Optional Polish Items

### 1. Abstract Hook (Still Passive)

The abstract still opens with "This paper synthesizes..." Consider whether the more engaging opening suggested in v3 would strengthen initial reader engagement.

**Current:** "This paper synthesizes existing research on consumer price inflation..."

**Alternative:** "U.S. inflation statistics have systematically evolved to report lower numbers, and the impact falls hardest on those least able to verify it..."

**Assessment:** Stylistic preference. Current version is acceptable for academic venues.

### 2. Figure Numbering Gap

Figures begin at Figure 3 (Figures 1-2 were removed in earlier iterations). This creates a minor discontinuity.

**Options:**
- Renumber all figures (1, 2, 3...)
- Add a note explaining deprecated figures
- Leave as-is (readers will not be confused)

**Assessment:** Minor. Renumbering is cleaner but not essential.

### 3. Hyphenation Audit

A few remaining inconsistencies:
- "necessity weighted" vs "necessity-weighted"
- "time cost" vs "time-cost"

**Assessment:** Minor. Copyediting issue for final production.

### 4. "Machine Intelligence" Terminology

The paper uses "machine intelligence" throughout. This is consistent but slightly unusual compared to "AI" or "artificial intelligence" which dominate current discourse. The term is defensible as more precise (encompassing various AI architectures), but readers may find it slightly stilted.

**Assessment:** Consistent usage is more important than terminology choice. Leave as-is or change consistently throughout.

## Strengths Confirmed

1. **Maria narrative** effectively grounds abstract claims in lived experience
2. **Policy prioritization** (quick wins / medium-term / long-term) is actionable
3. **Explicit disclaimers** about what the paper does/does not claim prevent misappropriation
4. **Risk acknowledgment** in Section 8.6 addresses conflict of interest
5. **Methodological appendix** enables replication
6. **Temporal caveats** acknowledge data limitations

---

## Recommendation

**Accept as-is** or with optional minor revisions at author's discretion.

The manuscript is ready for working paper distribution. For formal journal submission, apply target journal's style guide to references and consider the abstract hook.
