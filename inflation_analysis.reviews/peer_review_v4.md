# Peer Review: Iteration 4

**Manuscript:** "Measuring What Matters" (final review)

**Review Date:** December 2025

---

## Overall Assessment

The paper has reached publication-ready status. The Maria narrative is well-tempered with appropriate caveats. The policy recommendations are clearly prioritized. Temporal references are now explicit. Data precision is appropriate. Section transitions are smooth.

The remaining items are purely optional polish. This review recommends acceptance.

## Final Minor Items

### 1. Table 6.7 Summary Table Consistency

The summary table in Section 6.7 shows:
- "Time-Cost | Eggs +35%, beef +42%"
- But also references "84% more work-hours for down payment"

The 84% figure doesn't match the Table 6 format (which shows percentages). Consider consistency.

**Recommendation:** Either change 84% to work-hours format, or note that different metrics use different units. Minor issue.

### 2. Section 8.6 Risk Acknowledgment

The risk acknowledgment in 8.6 is thorough but could note one additional risk: that AI-generated analyses may be used to amplify existing institutional power (think tanks, lobbying firms) rather than democratizing it. The technology is dual-use.

**Recommendation:** Optional addition: "AI capabilities may equally be adopted by well-resourced institutions to produce more sophisticated advocacy, potentially widening rather than narrowing the analysis gap."

### 3. Reference Formatting

References are complete but use slightly inconsistent formatting:
- Some journal titles are italicized, some are not
- Some have volume/issue numbers, some do not
- DOIs are inconsistently included

**Recommendation:** Standardize to target journal's citation style before submission. Not a content issue.

## Assessment

**Recommendation: Accept**

The paper makes a contribution at the intersection of inflation measurement, information economics, and AI capabilities. The core claims are appropriately hedged. The novel metrics are constructible and interesting. The democratization thesis is presented with suitable caveats about limitations and risks.

Minor items above are optional improvements, not requirements.
