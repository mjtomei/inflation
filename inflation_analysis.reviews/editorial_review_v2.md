# Editorial Review: Iteration 2

**Manuscript:** "Measuring What Matters" (revised version)

**Review Date:** December 2025

---

## Style Issues

### 1. Abstract Density
The abstract now runs 350+ words with dense quantitative claims. While the numbers strengthen impact, the abstract may be too long for journal standards (typically 150-250 words).

**Recommendation:** Create two versions: a short abstract (200 words) for journal submission and the current extended abstract for working paper distribution.

### 2. Maria's Voice
The Maria narrative is effective but inconsistent in register. Section 6.1 uses accessible language ("Eggs cost twice what they did"); subsequent sections shift to academic register ("operationalizes the Engel's Law hypothesis"). Consider maintaining Maria's perspective throughout.

**Recommendation:** Keep Section 6 consistently in accessible register. Move academic references to footnotes or a brief analytical aside.

### 3. Section 8.4 Length
Section 8.4 ("Who Benefits") is the longest subsection in Section 8, at approximately 400 words. While the content is strong, it creates structural imbalance.

**Recommendation:** Trim to 300 words by condensing the historical parallels paragraph.

## Structural Issues

### 4. Policy Recommendations Placement
Section 9.3 introduces new substantive content (policy recommendations) after Section 9.2 ("Findings"). This violates the principle that conclusions should summarize, not add.

**Recommendation:** Either move policy recommendations to a new Section 10 before Conclusion, or integrate them into Section 8 as "Implications for Policy."

### 5. Appendix Order
Appendix B lists figures; Appendix C describes methodology. Readers typically expect methodology first. Consider reordering to: A (Data Sources), B (Methodology), C (Figure List).

**Recommendation:** Reorder appendices for logical flow.

## Factual Verification Needed

### 6. New Citations in Section 2.3
The following citations were added but may not appear in References:
- Darity and Myers (1998)
- Darity and Hamilton (2012)
- Oliver and Shapiro (2006)
- Derenoncourt et al. (2022)

**Recommendation:** Verify and add complete citations to References.

### 7. New Citations in Section 2.6
The following citations were added:
- Marshall and Wallace (2019)
- Taylor et al. (2022)
- Chen et al. (2021)
- Lopez-Lira and Tang (2023)
- Benkler (2006)
- Shirky (2008)
- Mullainathan and Spiess (2017)
- Athey and Imbens (2019)

**Recommendation:** Verify these are real publications and add to References.

## Prose Polish

### 8. Sentence: "The question is no longer whether..."
The sentence "The question is no longer whether we should trust official statistics" appears in Section 9.4. This framing has become a cliche. Consider varying.

**Recommendation:** Rewrite as: "The debate has shifted from whether to trust official statistics to whether institutions can adapt to a world of ubiquitous verification capability."

### 9. Repetition of "Machine intelligence"
The phrase "machine intelligence" appears 15+ times. Consider varying with "AI systems," "large language models," "automated analysis," etc.

**Recommendation:** Vary terminology while maintaining clarity.

## Summary

The paper is well-structured but needs: (1) reference verification for new citations; (2) consideration of abstract length; (3) consistent register in Maria narrative; (4) possible restructuring of policy recommendations.
