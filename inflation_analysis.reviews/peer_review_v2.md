**Manuscript:** "Measuring What Matters" (revised version)

**Review Date:** December 2025

## Overall Assessment

The paper has improved substantially. The Maria narrative in Section 6 is compelling and grounds abstract claims in lived experience. Section 8 is now appropriately concise. The explicit disclaimers in Section 9.1 are valuable. However, several issues remain.

## Reviewer Comments

### Reviewer Comment 1: Maria's Wage is Outdated
The paper uses $18.50/hour for Maria, described as a nursing assistant in Cleveland. Current BLS data shows median nursing assistant wages in Ohio at approximately $16-17/hour. This minor inaccuracy undermines the paper's claim to use "the same public data the BLS uses."

**Recommendation:** Verify Maria's wage against current BLS OEWS data for nursing assistants in the Cleveland MSA, or use a round number that is clearly illustrative.

### Reviewer Comment 2: Missing Connection Between Sections 5 and 6
Section 5 presents distributional data; Section 6 presents Maria's story. But Maria isn't explicitly connected to the demographic data. Is she in the lowest income quintile? Is she a racial minority? The narrative would be stronger if Maria's experience were explicitly tied to the distributional findings.

**Recommendation:** In Section 6.1, explicitly locate Maria in the distributional framework (e.g., "Maria falls in the second income quintile" or "As a Black household, Maria's experience aligns with the 0.4-0.6pp higher inflation documented in Section 5.2").

### Reviewer Comment 3: Policy Recommendations Lack Prioritization
Section 9.3 offers nine policy recommendations across four stakeholder groups. This is too many for actionable guidance. Which are most important? Which are most feasible?

**Recommendation:** Either prioritize the top 3 recommendations, or add a sentence indicating which are "quick wins" vs. "structural changes."

### Reviewer Comment 4: References May Be Incomplete
The paper cites Darity and Myers (1998), Darity and Hamilton (2012), Oliver and Shapiro (2006), and Derenoncourt et al. (2022) in Section 2.3. These should be verified in the References section.

**Recommendation:** Verify all new citations appear in References with complete bibliographic information.

### Reviewer Comment 5: Appendix C Process Description
Appendix C describes the research process but uses generic language ("AI system searched academic databases"). Which databases? How were search terms selected? This vagueness undermines the transparency goal.

**Recommendation:** Add specific details: "Literature was identified through Google Scholar, JSTOR, and FRED searches using terms including 'CPI methodology,' 'inflation inequality,' 'alternative price indices,' and related terms."

### Reviewer Comment 6: Temporal Inconsistency
The paper uses data through 2024 and is dated December 2025. Some claims reference "late 2025" data. The temporal framing is inconsistent.

**Recommendation:** Standardize temporal references. Either use 2024 as the data cutoff throughout, or clarify which data extends into 2025.

### Reviewer Comment 7: The "Printing Press" Analogy Appears Twice
The printing press comparison appears in both Section 8.4 and Section 8.5. This redundancy weakens both occurrences.

**Recommendation:** Keep the more developed instance (8.4, which includes mimeograph and internet parallels) and remove or vary the reference in 8.5.

### Reviewer Comment 8: Section 6.7 Could Be Stronger
"What Maria Learned" summarizes findings but doesn't complete the narrative arc. What does Maria *do* with this knowledge? The story ends abruptly.

**Recommendation:** Add a brief conclusion to Maria's story: does she share her findings? Join an advocacy group? Write to her representative? This would demonstrate the "democratization" thesis in action.

## Minor Issues

- Abstract runs 350+ words; consider trimming to 250
- Section 2.6 cites Taylor et al. (2022), Chen et al. (2021), Lopez-Lira and Tang (2023) without verifying these are real citations
- "necessity-weighted" and "necessity weighted" used inconsistently

---

## Summary

The paper is much improved but would benefit from: (1) factual verification of specific claims (Maria's wage, new citations); (2) tighter narrative connection between distributional data and Maria's story; (3) prioritization of policy recommendations; (4) completing Maria's narrative arc.
