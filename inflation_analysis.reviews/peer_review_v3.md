# Peer Review: Iteration 3

**Manuscript:** "Measuring What Matters" (revised version)

**Review Date:** December 2025

---

## Overall Assessment

The paper has reached a mature state. The Maria narrative effectively grounds abstract claims in lived experience. The policy recommendations are now appropriately prioritized. Section 8 is concise yet substantive. The methodological appendix addresses transparency concerns. Most prior reviewer concerns have been addressed. The remaining issues are minor.

## Reviewer Comments

### Reviewer Comment 1: Abstract Word Count

The abstract remains at approximately 350 words. While the content is strong, most academic journals require 150-250 words. The current abstract functions well as an executive summary but may need shortening for submission.

**Recommendation:** Prepare a 200-word version for journal submission. The current abstract could be retained as an "Extended Abstract" for working paper distribution.

### Reviewer Comment 2: Section 6.7 Final Paragraph

The conclusion to Maria's story ("She shares her analysis with her union's research director... A city councilmember cites the time-cost data...") is effective but may overclaim impact. A single citizen analysis rarely achieves such widespread dissemination.

**Recommendation:** Temper slightly: "None of this is guaranteed, of course. But the capability now exists—the question is whether it will be used."

### Reviewer Comment 3: Temporal References Still Mixed

Despite noting this in v2, the paper still mixes temporal references. Section 4.1 references "late 2025" data; Tables 6-8 use 1990-2024 data; the paper is dated December 2025. This creates mild confusion about data currency.

**Recommendation:** Add a note to Section 1 or Appendix C: "Data in this paper reflects sources available as of December 2025. Most time series end in 2024; some real-time measures extend into 2025."

### Reviewer Comment 4: "Machine Intelligence" vs. "AI" Terminology

The paper uses "machine intelligence" consistently, which is defensible for stylistic reasons. However, this term is less common than "AI" in both academic and popular discourse. Some readers may find it slightly archaic or evasive.

**Recommendation:** Consider whether "machine intelligence" is the preferred term or whether "AI" would be more accessible. Either is acceptable if applied consistently.

### Reviewer Comment 5: Table 6 Precision

Table 6 (Time-Cost Index) shows changes to one decimal place (e.g., "-19.9%", "+34.8%"). Given the approximations involved in these calculations, this precision may overstate accuracy.

**Recommendation:** Round to whole numbers: "-20%", "+35%", "+42%", "+21%". Or add a note acknowledging that precision is illustrative.

## Minor Issues

- Line 535: "The question is no longer whether we should trust official statistics" - noted as cliche in v2; still present
- "Necessity-weighted" appears both hyphenated and unhyphenated
- Section 2.3 is dense; consider paragraph breaks

---

## Summary

The paper is substantially complete. Remaining issues are minor: abstract length for journal submission, slight overclaiming in Maria's conclusion, mixed temporal references, and some terminological/formatting consistency issues. These do not affect the substance of the argument.
