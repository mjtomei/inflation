# Editorial Review: Iteration 3

**Manuscript:** "Measuring What Matters" (revised version)

**Review Date:** December 2025

---

## Style Issues

### 1. Opening Sentence of Abstract

The abstract opens with "This paper synthesizes existing research on consumer price inflation..." This is functional but passive. Consider leading with the finding rather than the method.

**Recommendation:** Revised opening: "U.S. inflation measurement has systematically evolved to report lower numbers—and the impact falls hardest on those least able to verify it. This paper synthesizes..."

### 2. Section Transitions

The transition from Section 5 to Section 6 is abrupt. Section 5 ends with spending composition data; Section 6 opens with Maria. A bridging sentence would help.

**Recommendation:** Add to Section 5.4 ending: "The following section demonstrates how these patterns manifest in individual experience."

### 3. Footnote Opportunity in Section 2.3

The paragraph on racial wealth gap scholars (Darity, Hamilton, Oliver & Shapiro, Derenoncourt) is important but interrupts the flow of Section 2.3. Consider moving citation details to a footnote while keeping the substantive point in the main text.

**Recommendation:** Main text: "This inflation inequality research builds on a deeper tradition of scholarship on racial economic disparities [see footnote]." Footnote contains the specific citations and years.

## Structural Issues

### 4. Appendix Order

Current order: A (Data Sources), B (Figure List), C (Methodology). The methodology appendix is most substantively important and should arguably come first or be elevated to main text.

**Recommendation:** Reorder to: A (Methodology/Transparency), B (Data Sources), C (Figure List). Or consider whether Appendix C content should be in the main paper.

### 5. Policy Recommendations Length

The prioritized policy recommendations (Section 9.3) are now well-organized but run to approximately 400 words. For a conclusion section, this is substantial. The content is good, but some readers expect conclusions to be brief summaries.

**Recommendation:** Either (a) move to new Section 10 "Policy Implications" before Conclusion, or (b) accept that this paper has a substantive rather than summary conclusion.

## Prose Polish

### 6. Sentence Variety in Section 8

Section 8 contains several consecutive sentences beginning with "The" or subject-first constructions. Consider varying syntax.

**Current:** "The capacity to measure has always been inseparable from the capacity to rule. The CPI itself originated in World War I wage adjustments. The analyses that once required..."

**Recommendation:** Vary some sentence openings: "For decades, producing authoritative economic statistics required..." (already present elsewhere - ensure variety throughout)

### 7. "Whether this paper demonstrates democratization or merely simulates it"

This closing line is strong but the word "simulates" may be too self-deprecating. It suggests the paper might be performance rather than substance.

**Recommendation:** Consider: "Whether this paper demonstrates democratization or merely illustrates its possibility is for readers to judge."

## Consistency

### 8. Hyphenation

- "necessity-weighted" vs. "necessity weighted"
- "time-cost" vs. "time cost"

**Recommendation:** Standardize. Compound modifiers before nouns typically take hyphens: "necessity-weighted index" but "the index is necessity weighted."

### 9. Figure Numbering

Figures 1-2 were removed but Figure 3 remains as the first figure. Consider renumbering: Figure 3 -> Figure 1, etc.

**Recommendation:** Renumber figures sequentially or add note explaining that Figures 1-2 were deprecated.

---

## Summary

The paper is publication-ready with minor editorial polish. Key remaining items: (1) consider abstract opening hook; (2) smooth Section 5-6 transition; (3) standardize hyphenation; (4) decide on appendix order; (5) potentially renumber figures. None affect substance.
